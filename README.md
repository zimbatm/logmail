sendmail-syslog
===============

Did you ever log into a server to discover that your local mailbox is full
of messages ? Maybe you wanted to know about cron failing in the backup task.

Did you even log into your mailbox and find it full of irrelevant messages
send by your system mailers ? Maybe you wanted to not clubber your mailbox
with these useless messages.

In both cases, the answer is sendmail-syslog. Once installed, it does what
it's name says. Coupled with a nice syslog aggregation tool (that you should
setup anyways), you can easily filter your messages and keep an eye on those
old programs that require a mailer.
